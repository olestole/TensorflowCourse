Directory containing all files worked on locally as part of **DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization**

The entire course is split into 4 smaller courses covering

- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
- Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

_Some of the older notebooks might not run as expected, as I haven't synced all the data from Coursera's own Jupyter environment_
